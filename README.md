## Welcome to inDiscovery!
inDiscovery is a new and seamless way to find a fresh game from an Indie Developer, when it feels like there's a million options and none at the same time. With inDiscovery, user's can interact with the site's randomizer, which will generate a completely random game for the user to play, or take the quiz to receive a set of 9 recommendations baased on their preferences. Finding a game to play with friends is no longer a headache, with inDiscovery!

## How to Use
While inDiscovery can be run on local machines (the process is outlined in our video above), we've hosted the app on Heroku to allow for a more seamless way to check our project out!

## Our Team
This project was completed by Nour Harrak, Ahmed Rahim, and Nesha Mervin. Our contributions are detailed below:

Nour Harrak - Nour was the Team Lead and primary Front-End Designer. As Team Lead, he managed the team's collaborative GitHub, organized tasks for the week, conducted progress checks, maintained the Issues and Project Boards. As Front-End Designer, Nour formed the site's general structure and design, primarily within HTML and CSS.

Ahmed Rahim - One of our two JavaScript Developers, Ahmed took on more of a back-end focus, working with the Internet Games Database to pull results for both the Randomizer and the Quiz, learning to understand the IGDB, as well as Node.js to create an environment in which the application could be run due to GitHub Pages limitations.

Nesha Mervin - Our second JavaScript Developer, Nesha took a focused job on the quiz portion itself, working with the team to define questions to ask the user, developing code to navigate the quiz forwards and backwards, and store user selections in SessionStorage, which was ultimately used to filter the results pulled from the API.

## Resources
The team's primary resources for the creation of this app were the Internet Games Database, which was used to fetch games for the site's primary functions, and Heroku, which was used to host the site outside of GitHub Pages, allowing us to solve limitations with static pages.
